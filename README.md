# CS300

This class was challenging but had some fun coding projects involved with it.

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
For this course we were using data sturctures and algorithms in code to read from a particular file.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I read the requirements, opend the supplied source code, and started plugging in code line by line until it worked.
Understanding how data structures work can help decide what to use for a certain program as far as complexity,
speed, and efficiency are concerned.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I had many issues with my code but using the resources available (the textbook and google) I was able 
to overcome them and resovle most issues. The instructor also was available and quick to respond were
there any issues the came up. Classmates came in handy as well in the discussions.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
This class had more coding than some of the other classes and helped me use problem solving skills to pinpoint 
specific issues with my code.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This class did not change the way I wrote programs but did help me become better at it. I did not have much experience
writing code to this point but I have a better understanding of it thanks to this class.
